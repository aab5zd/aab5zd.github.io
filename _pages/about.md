### Bridging Data and Insight

Hi, I'm Angela, an enthusiastic aspiring data scientist with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. As an entry-level data scientist, I am on a journey to explore the vast and dynamic world of data, constantly honing my skills to extract valuable information from numbers.

#### Academic Background: A Journey from Economics to Data Science

My fascination with data began during my undergraduate years at the University of Virginia, where I majored in economics and statistics. There, I delved into the realms of data analytics, programming in Python and R, and mastering SQL for effective database management. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex datasets into actionable intelligence. Beyond the academic realm, I immersed myself in a diverse array of subjects and experiences, from studying Spanish abroad in Valencia to exploring art, theatre, literature, and volunteering in the Charlottesville and UVA communities.

#### Internship Experience: Analyzing Marketing Data with Radify Labs

During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of interning with Radify Labs, where I honed my skills in marketing data analysis. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the practical application of data science in a business context.

#### Graduate Studies: UVAâ€™s MS in Data Science Program

Eager to deepen my understanding, I continued my education in UVA's MS in Data Science program. Here, I delved into advanced topics such as Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Advanced Quantitative Analysis, and Big Data Systems. Working on diverse projects with clients like MITRE and Hilton Hotels, I gained hands-on experience in completing end-to-end big data projects, utilizing the latest tools and cloud technologies.

#### Community Involvement: Advocating Diversity in Data Science

As a member of the inaugural graduate data science council, I proudly served as the council's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Chair. Initiating community outreach programs within UVA and Charlottesville, I aimed to broaden access to data science resources for underrepresented individuals, fostering an inclusive environment for learning and growth.

#### Current Endeavors: Building and Seeking Opportunities

Presently, I am immersed in personal data science projects, showcasing my passion and skills. Explore them on my [portfolio page](https://aab5zd.github.io/portfolio). Simultaneously, I am actively seeking full-time positions in data analysis or data science. I am enthusiastic about contributing to every aspect of the data lifecycle and am open to discussing potential opportunities within your organization.
