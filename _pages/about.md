### About Me

Hi, I’m Angela — a data scientist passionate about building scalable data systems, developing analytical solutions, and transforming complex data into meaningful insight. I specialize in large-scale data engineering, applied machine learning, and cloud-based analytics, with hands-on experience architecting end-to-end pipelines and working with sensitive, high-volume datasets in research and enterprise environments.

### Professional Experience

I currently work as a Computational Research Scientist at the University of Virginia, where I design and optimize data pipelines processing billions of records, build production-ready analytical software in Python, and collaborate with technical and domain experts across healthcare, social science, and computational research. My work ranges from distributed data ingestion and cloud architecture to statistical modeling and interactive visualization.

### Academic Background

My academic background includes a Master’s in Data Science and a Bachelor’s in Statistics & Economics from UVA, where I built strong foundations in quantitative analysis, ML systems, and computing. I’ve also supported applied data science projects with public and private organizations, including research labs, clinical teams, and enterprise partners.

### Areas of Focus

Today, I continue to explore the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, and real-world impact — whether building scalable analytic infrastructure, studying human-centered and scientific data, or investigating emerging applications of AI.
